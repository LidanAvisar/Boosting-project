# Boosting Algorithms Notebook

This project provides a hands-on implementation and analysis of boosting techniques in machine learning, focusing on methods like AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting. The notebook demonstrates how weak learners can be sequentially combined to form a strong predictive model.

## Project Highlights

- Implementation of popular boosting algorithms
- Comparison between AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting
- Visualizations of model performance and decision boundaries
- Practical use on real-world datasets

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## File Structure

Boosting.ipynb        # Main notebook with implementations and evaluations

## Running the Notebook

To run the notebook locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/LidanAvisar/boosting-project.git
   cd boosting-project

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
